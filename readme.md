# MIPS Projects

This repository contains a collection of MIPS projects that demonstrate my understanding of MIPS concepts, such as the stack pointer and instruction sets. Each project focuses on a specific task and showcases different aspects of MIPS programming.

## Project 1: TestFunction
The **TestFunction** project showcases the utilization of functions in MIPS. It calculates the sum of numbers in an array using a function. The project demonstrates how to define and call functions in MIPS, as well as the usage of registers for storing, returning, and manipulating data.

## Project 2: TestHex
The **TestHex** project deals with converting a non-negative integer into its hexadecimal representation. It prompts the user to input a number and then converts it to hexadecimal format. The project highlights the bitwise operations and branching logic used in MIPS to perform the conversion.

## Project 3: TestStack
The **TestStack** project focuses on utilizing the stack pointer in MIPS. It demonstrates how to store a set of numbers into the stack, perform calculations on the stored values, and retrieve the result. The project showcases the stack management and function calling conventions in MIPS.

These projects serve as examples of my proficiency in MIPS programming and can be a valuable resource for understanding MIPS concepts.
